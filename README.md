# Scenario Validation

This is a simple traffic scenario validation framework developed based on the learning from the original Carla Challenge's Scenario Runner repository at https://github.com/carla-simulator/scenario_runner.

This framework makes use of the new TrafficManager mechanism to control vehicles.
